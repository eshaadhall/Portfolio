# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website for Full stack javascript developer.

I have used Node JS, Express, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap and Pug to build this website.

Extra Credit:
Page not found error page displays the error.message, error.status and error.stack in the error.pug file under views folder.

Customized the style of the css of the home page and the error 404-not found page.
